    The Kallakurichi Collectorate serves as the administrative headquarters for Kallakurichi District in Tamil Nadu, India.
    Established on November 26, 2019, when the district was officially inaugurated, the Collectorate plays a pivotal role in district administration.
    The District Collector, an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, leads the Collectorate, overseeing law and order,
     planning and development, and general administration. Supporting the Collector are the District Revenue Officer (DRO) and 
     Deputy Collectors, who manage revenue administration, civil supplies, land matters, and other essential functions.
