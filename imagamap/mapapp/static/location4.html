    The Kalvarayan Hills, part of the Eastern Ghats in Tamil Nadu, India, 
    span approximately 1,095 square kilometers with elevations ranging from 2,000 to 3,000 feet. 
    They act as a natural divide between the Kaveri and Palar river basins.
    The hills are divided into two sections: the Chinna (Little) Kalrayans in the north,
     averaging 2,700 feet, and the Periya (Big) Kalrayans in the south, averaging 4,000 feet. 
     The terrain supports diverse vegetation, including scrub jungles up to 400 meters, deciduous 
     forests above 800 meters, and high-altitude stunted evergreen forests known as 'sholas' on isolated plateaus.
